# Wrenches and You

Some blocks have the ability to be manipulated via the **Wrench from Create**.  
This mod has this integrated as well for the RedRouter Block and Animatronic.

The RedRouter Block can be rotated in **90째 steps**, while the Animatronic can be rotated in **45째 steps**.

!!! note
    The Animatronic's rotation can be set to **any number from 0째 to 360째** by manipulating the **blockstate** using the **Debug Stick** or the `/setblock` command.

## Shift right click

By shift right clicking, both the **RedRouter Block and the Animatronic can be  removed** and placed **in your inventory instantly**.
